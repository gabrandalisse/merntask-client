# 📝 MERNTasks

The MERNTasks app it's a project that I built in my process of learning and practice the MERN stack.
The project it's simple, it's like Trello, it allows the user to organize and trak the tasks that conforms your project. 
Like I've said, this app was developed with the MERN stack. For the frontend I used React and thanks to one of it's functions that is useContext it allowed to me control the state of all the app more easily and made it more maintainable.
For the backend I created a few endpoints with the help of express.js, and so I implemented the MVC model.
